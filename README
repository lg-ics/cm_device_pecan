These are my modified device files for a clean CM9 installation. In this package are also included:

- some prebuilf libs
- 2 different kernels

If you wanna know more please refer to our official site: www.xmodteam.tk

IMPORTANT
---------
In prebuilt there are 2 kernel:

- zImage_old : working kernel (2.6.32)
- zImage: new kernel 2.6.35 (not works touch i need to fix this) 

Also modules are _old and not and related to kernel you want to use. Rename to ouse new or old kernel (delete_old)
